The \\nMuslims comprise the dynasties ruling a patchwork of Andalu-\\nsian emirates and their allies, including an Islamic Berber army \\nfrom Africa. \\nIn turns covering 40 days (a traditional period of military service), \\nChristian and Muslim players will levy lords and vassal forces, \\ngather transport, and recruit capabilities. Each lord’s forces and \\nassets are laid out on a mat. The players then plan and command a \\n40-day campaign with their mustered lords.

Players continue to alternate\\nCommand Activations until the Plan stacks are exhausted.\\n• End Campaign: \\nAfter both Plan stacks are exhausted and\\nCommand Activations finished, the Campaign ends. Players\\nreset as listed at 4.9. Then, if this was not the last Campaign\\nof the scenario, advance the Campaign marker to the next 40-\\nDays box and flip it to Levy .\\n4.1 Plan\\nChristians then Muslims each complete the Plan step as follows. \\nThe player builds a stack of face-down Command cards (1.9.2) \\nfor that side called a Plan. Players may always inspect their own \\nPlan and their opponent’s played Command cards (but not un-\\nused ones). The number of cards in each Plan stack must equal \\nthe following, depending on the current Season (and as noted on \\nthe Calendar):\\n• Spring: 7 Command cards.\\n• Summer:\\n 8 Command cards.\\n• Autumn: 7 Command cards.\\n4.1.1 Selecting Cards.\\n A side may select from among any of their \\ncurrently Mustered Lords’ Command cards for the Plan. If a side \\ndoes not have enough Lords Mustered to fill out the above total, \\nit must add Pass cards (1.9.2) to build a stack of that number of \\nCommand cards. NOTE: Each Lord has three Command cards or \\n\\uf075 four if a Marshal and so could become Active up to that many\\ntimes in a single Campaign.\\n4.1.2 Arranging Stacks: Each side builds its Plan for the com-\\ning Campaign by arranging its seven or eight selected Command \\ncards in any order desired, face down. The top face-down card \\nwill be that side’s first Active Lord, and so on. Set remaining \\nCommand cards aside for now, also face down. Players may not \\nrearrange Plan stacks once built.\\nPLAY NOTE: When arranging one’ s Plan stack, fan the cards \\nto show the order of Lords by corner Pennant from left to right, \\nthen flip face down.\\n4.1.3 Lieutenants. During this step (only), play-\\ners may put a Lord cylinder of their side on top of \\none other cylinder at the same Locale. The upper \\nLord is a Lieutenant, overseeing the Lower Lord \\nfor the entire Campaign, barring removal of ei-\\nther. A Lieutenant may have only one Lower \\nLord at a time. A side may have several Lieutenants. A Marshal \\n(1.5.1) may not be a Lieutenant or Lower Lord. NOTE: The \\nAlférez card (1.9.1) can create or unstack a Lieutenant during \\nCampaign.\\n• A \\nLieutenant and his Lower Lord always move together in\\nMarch, Retreat, and so on (4.3, 4.4.3).\\n• If a Lieutenant or his Lower Lord Disbands while the other\\ndoes not, the remaining Lord becomes a normal Lord.\\n• Revealing a \\nLower Lord’s Command card results in a Pass\\n(4.2.3).'}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",

       "['Players must keep an eye on the calendar and \\nreward lords to keep them in the field. \\nAn advanced rule adds detail on vassal forces’ length of service. \\nPlayers may use optional screens that hide the strength of their \\nlords for greater fog of war. Though Almoravid has no solitaire \\nsystem, the standard game is solitaire friendly. \\nA player aid foldout and a separate Taifa reference sheet sum-\\nmarize key game functions. The last few pages of this rule book \\nprovide scenarios and key terms. A background booklet has sup-\\nporting material such as examples of play, tips on solitaire and \\nteam play, detailed histories of the era, and a separate minigame \\non its greatest battle.\\nThe page opposite lists rules changes from Levy & Campaign \\nSeries V olume I, Nevsky. In addition, this icon \\uf075 precedes such \\nnew rules sections and concepts in this rules booklet.\\n1.1 General Course of Play\\nIn Almoravid, two players (or teams) take the roles of Christians \\n(yellow) and Muslims (green), respectively. The Christian and \\nMuslim sides are Enemy to one another. The Christians repre-\\nsent the rising kingdoms of northern Spain and their allies. The \\nMuslims comprise the dynasties ruling a patchwork of Andalu-\\nsian emirates and their allies, including an Islamic Berber army \\nfrom Africa. \\nIn turns covering 40 days (a traditional period of military service), \\nChristian and Muslim players will levy lords and vassal forces, \\ngather transport, and recruit capabilities. Each lord’s forces and \\nassets are laid out on a mat. The players then plan and command a \\n40-day campaign with their mustered lords. A cylinder on the map\\nrepresents each lord, while markers on a calendar show how much\\ntime remains in the lords’ service, influenced by hunger, pay, and\\nsuccess or failure on campaign.\\nDESIGN NOTE: Christians and Muslims in medieval Ibe-\\nria warred not only on each other but on their co-religionists. \\n“Christian” and “Muslim” in this game refer to the player sides, \\neven though each side features adherents of either religion.\\n1.2 Components\\nA complete set of Almoravid includes: \\n• A mounted game board (1.3)\\n• Sixteen Lord cylinders (7 yellow, 9 green; 1.5.1)\\n• A Lords sticker sheet (1.5.1, apply to cylinders)\\n• Sixteen Lord mats (1.5.2)\\n• One Battle/Storm mat (4.4.1)\\n• 78 Horse \\nwedges (26 silver [Knights], 23 steel [Sergeants], 10\\nblue [African Horse], 19 brown [Light Horse])\\n• 83 Foot bars (30 steel [Men-at-Arms], 14 blue [African Foot],\\n33 brown [Militia], 6 tan [Serfs])\\n• Three sheets of markers and counters.\\n• Four decks of playing cards (26 Christian and 26 Muslim Arts\\nof W\\nar cards, 27 Christian and 33 Muslim Command cards, 1.9)\\n• Two player aid foldouts (summarizing Sequence of Play,\\nCommands, Forces, and Battles)\\n• A Taifa Politics and Orientation Map reference sheet (1.3.1, 1.4)\\n• Two screens\\n• Six 6-sided dice (three yellow, three green)\\n• A background booklet (not needed for play)\\n• This rules booklet.\\n1.3 Game Board and Map\\n1.3.1 Map. The game board shows a map of much of Spain, circa \\n1085. It depicts Locales linked by Ways, a Calendar along the left, \\nand a Taifas (Muslim emirates) box in one corner. See also the \\norientation map on back of the Taifa Politics sheet. \\nSeason\\nLocales\\nRoad Way Pass Way Taifas box\\nMuslim Territory \\n(“Taifas”)\\nCalendar 40-Days box\\nChristian Territory \\n(“Kingdoms”)\\n\\n© 2021 GMT Games, LLC\\nAlmoravid\\n4\\nTERRITORY: Christian Territory comprises two Kingdoms in \\nthe north bordered in gold—León and Aragón. Muslim Territo-\\nry comprises seven Taifas bordered in green—Badajoz, Toledo, \\nZaragoza, Lérida, Sevilla, Granada, and Valencia. \\uf075 Taifas can \\nbecome a “Parias” Taifa or “Reconquista” Taifa, rendering it Neu-\\ntral or Christian Territory instead (see ALLEGIANCE, below, and \\nTaifa Politics, 1.4).',\n",
       " '4.0 CAMPAIGN\\nAfter Levy, players conduct that 40 Days’ Campaign. Complete \\nthe steps below, then proceed to the next Levy (3.0). The Se-\\nquence of Play page of the foldout summarizes the steps.\\nCAPABILITY DISCARD: The players (Christian first) must \\nselect and discard any Capability cards they have in excess of \\ntheir number of Mustered Lords—not including any “This Lord” \\nCapabilities (3.4.4). Compare the number of cards tucked under \\na side’s map edge to its number of Lord mats in use—the player \\nmust discard any excess.\\nCAMPAIGN STEPS:\\n• Plan:\\n Each side builds a Campaign Plan—an ordered stack of\\nCommand cards—and may designate Lieutenants to lead other\\nLords (4.1.3); Muslims may deposit Taifa Coin (4.1.4).\\n• Command Activation:\\n Starting with the Christian player, one\\nside flips its top Command card and executes (if desired) Com-\\nmand actions (4.2-4.7) by the Lord on that card or Passes back\\nto the other side if a Pass card.\\no Actions:\\n One side is Active, using actions to execute Com-\\nmands; the other side is Inactive.\\no Feed/Pay/Disband:\\n At the end of each card, both sides Feed\\nForces of Lords who are marked as Moved or Fought, may\\nPay those Lords, then check whether they Disband (4.8).\\n• More \\nCommand Activations: The Muslim player next flips\\nthe top Muslim card and executes a Muslim Command Acti-\\nvation as above (actions, Feed). Players continue to alternate\\nCommand Activations until the Plan stacks are exhausted.\\n• End Campaign: \\nAfter both Plan stacks are exhausted and\\nCommand Activations finished, the Campaign ends. Players\\nreset as listed at 4.9. Then, if this was not the last Campaign\\nof the scenario, advance the Campaign marker to the next 40-\\nDays box and flip it to Levy .\\n4.1 Plan\\nChristians then Muslims each complete the Plan step as follows. \\nThe player builds a stack of face-down Command cards (1.9.2) \\nfor that side called a Plan. Players may always inspect their own \\nPlan and their opponent’s played Command cards (but not un-\\nused ones). The number of cards in each Plan stack must equal \\nthe following, depending on the current Season (and as noted on \\nthe Calendar):\\n• Spring: 7 Command cards.\\n• Summer:\\n 8 Command cards.\\n• Autumn: 7 Command cards.\\n4.1.1 Selecting Cards.\\n A side may select from among any of their \\ncurrently Mustered Lords’ Command cards for the Plan. If a side \\ndoes not have enough Lords Mustered to fill out the above total, \\nit must add Pass cards (1.9.2) to build a stack of that number of \\nCommand cards. NOTE: Each Lord has three Command cards or \\n\\uf075 four if a Marshal and so could become Active up to that many\\ntimes in a single Campaign.\\n4.1.2 Arranging Stacks: Each side builds its Plan for the com-\\ning Campaign by arranging its seven or eight selected Command \\ncards in any order desired, face down. The top face-down card \\nwill be that side’s first Active Lord, and so on. Set remaining \\nCommand cards aside for now, also face down. Players may not \\nrearrange Plan stacks once built.\\nPLAY NOTE: When arranging one’ s Plan stack, fan the cards \\nto show the order of Lords by corner Pennant from left to right, \\nthen flip face down.\\n4.1.3 Lieutenants. During this step (only), play-\\ners may put a Lord cylinder of their side on top of \\none other cylinder at the same Locale. The upper \\nLord is a Lieutenant, overseeing the Lower Lord \\nfor the entire Campaign, barring removal of ei-\\nther. A Lieutenant may have only one Lower \\nLord at a time. A side may have several Lieutenants. A Marshal \\n(1.5.1) may not be a Lieutenant or Lower Lord. NOTE: The \\nAlférez card (1.9.1) can create or unstack a Lieutenant during \\nCampaign.\\n• A \\nLieutenant and his Lower Lord always move together in\\nMarch, Retreat, and so on (4.3, 4.4.3).\\n• If a Lieutenant or his Lower Lord Disbands while the other\\ndoes not, the remaining Lord becomes a normal Lord.\\n• Revealing a \\nLower Lord’s Command card results in a Pass\\n(4.2.3).',\n",
       " 'The owning \\nplayer chooses each Lord’s fate among the above, \\nwithin the following requirements. \\n• Defenders may not Retreat along any part of the \\nWay that At-\\ntackers used to Approach the Locale.\\n• Marching Attackers who Retreat \\nmust return to the Locale\\nfrom which they Approached (4.3.4).\\n• Sallying Attackers must \\nWithdraw back into their Stronghold.\\nLOSSES: Both sides check for removal of Routed Forces per \\n4.4.4 below. \\nSPOILS: Lords on the losing side of a Battle may have to imme-\\ndiately transfer Assets to Lords on the winning side; the winning \\nplayer distributes these Assets among mats of Lords at the Locale:\\n• Losing Lords who were permanently \\nremoved  (by Losses or\\nfor being unable to Retreat or Withdraw) or who Retreated\\nwithout having Conceded the Field  (4.4.2-.3) transfer all their\\nAssets.\\n• Lords who Conceded and Retreated\\n transfer all Loot and any\\nProvender beyond that which they could take along the Retreat\\nWay without being Laden (4.3.2) but lose no other Assets.\\n• Lords who W\\nithdrew keep all their Assets.\\nSERVICE: The losing side rolls one die for each of its Retreat -\\ned Lords and shifts that Lord’s Service marker (and, if using the \\nadvanced Vassal Service rule, 3.4.2, each of his Vassals’ markers) \\nleft one box on a roll of 1 or 2, two boxes on a 3 or 4, or three \\nboxes on a 5 or 6.

After losing Lords Retreat, Withdraw, or are perma-\\nnently removed in a Sack (4.5.2), both sides determine the fate of \\ntheir Routed units:\\n• Roll a die for each Routed unit.\\n• For units of Lords who Retreated without having Conceded the\\nField (4.4.2-.3), remove all Routed units that fail to roll a “1”.\\n• For all other Lords, compare each unit’s roll to its inherent\\nArmor\\n, Evasion, or Unarmored Protection. Use the Protection\\nroll range shown on the Forces table for that type, unmodi-\\nfied by Events, Capabilities, or Battle/Storm situation. African\\nHorse always uses its Evade range.\\n• Push Routed \\nunits that roll within these ranges above the line\\non their Lord’s mat—they are no longer Routed. Remove\\nRouted units that fail their roll to the pool.

After determining Spoils and Losses, con-\\nclude the Battle or Storm as follows.\\n• Moved/Fought: Mark all Attacking \\nand Defending Lords\\nFought (if not already marked).\\n• Events: Discard \\nall Hold Events (3.1.3) used in this Battle or\\nStorm.\\n• Siege: If \\nthe combat created or ended a Siege, place or remove\\nSiege, Conquered, and Jihad markers accordingly and adjust\\nVictory (1.4, 4.3.4-.5, 4.5.2, 5.1).\\n• Recovery:  Skip any remaining actions on this Command card.\\nGo to Feed/Pay/Disband (4.8).\\nImportant: A Battle or Storm blocks any further Command \\nactions on the current Command card.\\n4.5 Siege, Storm, and Sally\\nLords at Siege Locales (4.3.5) may take actions to advance the \\nSiege or to Storm or Sally (Attack).\\n4.5.1 Siege. Any Besieging Lord may use all actions of his Com-\\nmand card to advance a Siege in the following order.\\nPLAY NOTE: Stacked Siege markers may reduce at the end of \\neach Campaign (4.9.3).\\nSURRENDER? If the Siege Locale has no Besieged Lords, the \\nBesieging side may roll for Surrender. \\uf075 It rolls a number of dice \\nequal to the Stronghold’s VP value (as shown by 1, 2, or 3 die \\nsymbols at the Stronghold as a reminder).',\n",

       " '3.1 Arts of War \\nEach side first draws two random Arts of War cards as Capabili-\\nties or Events as follows. \\n3.1.1 Shuffle. Collect and shuffle all unused Christian Arts of War \\ncards into an Event draw deck; do the same for the Muslim play-\\ner. Do not include Held Events (3.1.3), Capability cards in play \\n(3.4.4), or removed cards (C18 Milites ) in the draw deck.\\n3.1.2 Draw Capabilities. If it is the Levy for the scenario’s first \\n40 Days, the Christian player then the Muslim player (2.2.4) each \\nrandomly draws two Arts of War cards from the player’s own \\ndeck and deploys them as Capabilities (lower half of the card, \\n1.9.1) at that side’s map edge or Lord mats (1.5.2).\\n• Any “This Lord” \\ncard that cannot be assigned to a Mustered\\nLord (3.4.1) adds no Capability.\\n3.1.3 Draw Events. If it is the second or any later Levy, the \\nChristian then the Muslim player each draws and implements two \\ncards’ Events in the order drawn (the upper half of each card, \\n1.9.1). Except as specified below, reveal Events immediately and \\nreturn the revealed cards to the deck after this Events segment. \\nBold-italic card text specifies certain Event types:\\n• “This Levy”  Events \\nare in effect for the entire ensuing Levy\\nand are not returned to their deck until the end of both sides’\\nLevy activities. The Capability on the bottom half of such a\\ncard will not be available for selection this Levy.\\n• Players keep all \\ndrawn “Hold” Events hidden for later use.\\nWhen played on a specific Lord, tuck the card under the top\\nedge of that Lord’s mat, so that the Event text shows.\\nNOTES: A side’ s Events can affect the opposing side. The side \\nplaying an Event card makes any decisions allowed unless other-\\nwise specified. It is possible for an Event’ s text to have no effect on \\nthe current situation in the game.\\n3.1.4 Greed. Players may not discard (as opposed to use) cards \\nunless permitted by a rule. EXAMPLE: Hold Events only return \\nto their deck once used per the text on the card or if selected for \\ndiscard at the end of a Campaign (4.9.5).\\n© 2021 GMT Games, LLC\\nAlmoravid\\n12\\n3.2 Pay \\nAfter drawing cards, the Christian then Muslim player may spend \\nCoin and Loot markers to encourage their Lords to remain in the \\nfield longer. Coin and Loot may be removed in this step only so as \\nto actually shift Service markers (1.7.2).\\n3.2.1 Pay with Coin. Lords with Coin on their mat \\nmay remove any of their Coin desired to affect their \\nown or other Lords’ Service. Any Muslim Lords \\nmay do so with Taifa Coin (1.3.3). Each Coin spent \\nshifts a Service marker on the Calendar rightward by one 40-\\nDays box, either: \\n• The paying Lord’s own Service marker, OR\\n• The Service marker of another Lord \\nat the same Locale as the\\npaying Lord, OR \\n• If Coin from the Taifas box, \\nthe Service of any Unbesieged\\nMuslim Lord (he may be Bypassed).\\n3.2.2 Pay with Loot. Players may have any of their \\nLords who are in a Friendly Locale (1.3.1) free of \\nSiege (they may be Bypassed) remove any Loot \\nmarkers on their mat desired to shift their own Ser-\\nvice marker or those of Lords in the same Locale. Shift one mark-\\ner by one 40-Days box rightward for each Loot removed.\\nImportant: A Lord must be in a Friendly Locale free of Siege \\nto Pay with Loot. He may do so at a Stronghold Conquered by \\nhis side, for example, but not at a Neutral or Besieged Locale.\\n3.3 Disband\\nThe Christian player then the Muslim player may then have to \\nremove certain Lords from the map because of the position of that \\nLord’s Service marker on the Calendar (1.5.1, 2.2). NOTE: Be-\\nsieged Lords (4.3.5) Disband normally per below. Rarely, a Lord \\nmay Disband per 3.3.2 because his last unit is removed outside \\nof combat.\\n3.3.1 Beyond Service \\nLimit.',\n",

The Se-\\nquence of Play page of the foldout summarizes the steps.\\nCAPABILITY DISCARD: The players (Christian first) must \\nselect and discard any Capability cards they have in excess of \\ntheir number of Mustered Lords—not including any “This Lord” \\nCapabilities (3.4.4). Compare the number of cards tucked under \\na side’s map edge to its number of Lord mats in use—the player \\nmust discard any excess.\\nCAMPAIGN STEPS:\\n• Plan:\\n Each side builds a Campaign Plan—an ordered stack of\\nCommand cards—and may designate Lieutenants to lead other\\nLords (4.1.3); Muslims may deposit Taifa Coin (4.1.4).\\n• Command Activation:\\n Starting with the Christian player, one\\nside flips its top Command card and executes (if desired) Com-\\nmand actions (4.2-4.7) by the Lord on that card or Passes back\\nto the other side if a Pass card.\\no Actions:\\n One side is Active, using actions to execute Com-\\nmands; the other side is Inactive.\\no Feed/Pay/Disband:\\n At the end of each card, both sides Feed\\nForces of Lords who are marked as Moved or Fought, may\\nPay those Lords, then check whether they Disband (4.8).\\n• More \\nCommand Activations: The Muslim player next flips\\nthe top Muslim card and executes a Muslim Command Acti-\\nvation as above (actions, Feed). Players continue to alternate\\nCommand Activations until the Plan stacks are exhausted.\\n• End Campaign: \\nAfter both Plan stacks are exhausted and\\nCommand Activations finished, the Campaign ends. Players\\nreset as listed at 4.9. Then, if this was not the last Campaign\\nof the scenario, advance the Campaign marker to the next 40-\\nDays box and flip it to Levy .\\n4.1 Plan\\nChristians then Muslims each complete the Plan step as follows. \\nThe player builds a stack of face-down Command cards (1.9.2) \\nfor that side called a Plan. Players may always inspect their own \\nPlan and their opponent’s played Command cards (but not un-\\nused ones). The number of cards in each Plan stack must equal \\nthe following, depending on the current Season (and as noted on \\nthe Calendar):\\n• Spring: 7 Command cards.\\n• Summer:\\n 8 Command cards.\\n• Autumn: 7 Command cards.\\n4.1.1 Selecting Cards.\\n A side may select from among any of their \\ncurrently Mustered Lords’ Command cards for the Plan. If a side \\ndoes not have enough Lords Mustered to fill out the above total, \\nit must add Pass cards (1.9.2) to build a stack of that number of \\nCommand cards. NOTE: Each Lord has three Command cards or \\n\\uf075 four if a Marshal and so could become Active up to that many\\ntimes in a single Campaign.\\n4.1.2 Arranging Stacks: Each side builds its Plan for the com-\\ning Campaign by arranging its seven or eight selected Command \\ncards in any order desired, face down. The top face-down card \\nwill be that side’s first Active Lord, and so on. Set remaining \\nCommand cards aside for now, also face down. Players may not \\nrearrange Plan stacks once built.\\nPLAY NOTE: When arranging one’ s Plan stack, fan the cards \\nto show the order of Lords by corner Pennant from left to right, \\nthen flip face down.\\n4.1.3 Lieutenants. During this step (only), play-\\ners may put a Lord cylinder of their side on top of \\none other cylinder at the same Locale. The upper \\nLord is a Lieutenant, overseeing the Lower Lord \\nfor the entire Campaign, barring removal of ei-\\nther. A Lieutenant may have only one Lower \\nLord at a time. A side may have several Lieutenants. A Marshal \\n(1.5.1) may not be a Lieutenant or Lower Lord. NOTE: The \\nAlférez card (1.9.1) can create or unstack a Lieutenant during \\nCampaign.\\n• A \\nLieutenant and his Lower Lord always move together in\\nMarch, Retreat, and so on (4.3, 4.4.3).\\n• If a Lieutenant or his Lower Lord Disbands while the other\\ndoes not, the remaining Lord becomes a normal Lord.\\n• Revealing a \\nLower Lord’s Command card results in a Pass\\n(4.2.3).',\n",

       " '3.1 Arts of War \\nEach side first draws two random Arts of War cards as Capabili-\\nties or Events as follows. \\n3.1.1 Shuffle. Collect and shuffle all unused Christian Arts of War \\ncards into an Event draw deck; do the same for the Muslim play-\\ner. Do not include Held Events (3.1.3), Capability cards in play \\n(3.4.4), or removed cards (C18 Milites ) in the draw deck.\\n3.1.2 Draw Capabilities. If it is the Levy for the scenario’s first \\n40 Days, the Christian player then the Muslim player (2.2.4) each \\nrandomly draws two Arts of War cards from the player’s own \\ndeck and deploys them as Capabilities (lower half of the card, \\n1.9.1) at that side’s map edge or Lord mats (1.5.2).\\n• Any “This Lord” \\ncard that cannot be assigned to a Mustered\\nLord (3.4.1) adds no Capability.\\n3.1.3 Draw Events. If it is the second or any later Levy, the \\nChristian then the Muslim player each draws and implements two \\ncards’ Events in the order drawn (the upper half of each card, \\n1.9.1). Except as specified below, reveal Events immediately and \\nreturn the revealed cards to the deck after this Events segment. \\nBold-italic card text specifies certain Event types:\\n• “This Levy”  Events \\nare in effect for the entire ensuing Levy\\nand are not returned to their deck until the end of both sides’\\nLevy activities. The Capability on the bottom half of such a\\ncard will not be available for selection this Levy.\\n• Players keep all \\ndrawn “Hold” Events hidden for later use.\\nWhen played on a specific Lord, tuck the card under the top\\nedge of that Lord’s mat, so that the Event text shows.\\nNOTES: A side’ s Events can affect the opposing side. The side \\nplaying an Event card makes any decisions allowed unless other-\\nwise specified. It is possible for an Event’ s text to have no effect on \\nthe current situation in the game.\\n3.1.4 Greed. Players may not discard (as opposed to use) cards \\nunless permitted by a rule. EXAMPLE: Hold Events only return \\nto their deck once used per the text on the card or if selected for \\ndiscard at the end of a Campaign (4.9.5).\\n© 2021 GMT Games, LLC\\nAlmoravid\\n12\\n3.2 Pay \\nAfter drawing cards, the Christian then Muslim player may spend \\nCoin and Loot markers to encourage their Lords to remain in the \\nfield longer. Coin and Loot may be removed in this step only so as \\nto actually shift Service markers (1.7.2).\\n3.2.1 Pay with Coin. Lords with Coin on their mat \\nmay remove any of their Coin desired to affect their \\nown or other Lords’ Service. Any Muslim Lords \\nmay do so with Taifa Coin (1.3.3). Each Coin spent \\nshifts a Service marker on the Calendar rightward by one 40-\\nDays box, either: \\n• The paying Lord’s own Service marker, OR\\n• The Service marker of another Lord \\nat the same Locale as the\\npaying Lord, OR \\n• If Coin from the Taifas box, \\nthe Service of any Unbesieged\\nMuslim Lord (he may be Bypassed).\\n3.2.2 Pay with Loot. Players may have any of their \\nLords who are in a Friendly Locale (1.3.1) free of \\nSiege (they may be Bypassed) remove any Loot \\nmarkers on their mat desired to shift their own Ser-\\nvice marker or those of Lords in the same Locale. Shift one mark-\\ner by one 40-Days box rightward for each Loot removed.\\nImportant: A Lord must be in a Friendly Locale free of Siege \\nto Pay with Loot. He may do so at a Stronghold Conquered by \\nhis side, for example, but not at a Neutral or Besieged Locale.\\n3.3 Disband\\nThe Christian player then the Muslim player may then have to \\nremove certain Lords from the map because of the position of that \\nLord’s Service marker on the Calendar (1.5.1, 2.2). NOTE: Be-\\nsieged Lords (4.3.5) Disband normally per below. Rarely, a Lord \\nmay Disband per 3.3.2 because his last unit is removed outside \\nof combat.\\n3.3.1 Beyond Service \\nLimit.',\n",

The Christian and \\nMuslim sides are Enemy to one another. The Christians repre-\\nsent the rising kingdoms of northern Spain and their allies. The \\nMuslims comprise the dynasties ruling a patchwork of Andalu-\\nsian emirates and their allies, including an Islamic Berber army \\nfrom Africa. \\nIn turns covering 40 days (a traditional period of military service), \\nChristian and Muslim players will levy lords and vassal forces, \\ngather transport, and recruit capabilities. Each lord’s forces and \\nassets are laid out on a mat. The players then plan and command a \\n40-day campaign with their mustered lords. A cylinder on the map\\nrepresents each lord, while markers on a calendar show how much\\ntime remains in the lords’ service, influenced by hunger, pay, and\\nsuccess or failure on campaign.\\nDESIGN NOTE: Christians and Muslims in medieval Ibe-\\nria warred not only on each other but on their co-religionists. \\n“Christian” and “Muslim” in this game refer to the player sides, \\neven though each side features adherents of either religion.\\n1.2 Components\\nA complete set of Almoravid includes: \\n• A mounted game board (1.3)\\n• Sixteen Lord cylinders (7 yellow, 9 green; 1.5.1)\\n• A Lords sticker sheet (1.5.1, apply to cylinders)\\n• Sixteen Lord mats (1.5.2)\\n• One Battle/Storm mat (4.4.1)\\n• 78 Horse \\nwedges (26 silver [Knights], 23 steel [Sergeants], 10\\nblue [African Horse], 19 brown [Light Horse])\\n• 83 Foot bars (30 steel [Men-at-Arms], 14 blue [African Foot],\\n33 brown [Militia], 6 tan [Serfs])\\n• Three sheets of markers and counters.\\n• Four decks of playing cards (26 Christian and 26 Muslim Arts\\nof W\\nar cards, 27 Christian and 33 Muslim Command cards, 1.9)\\n• Two player aid foldouts (summarizing Sequence of Play,\\nCommands, Forces, and Battles)\\n• A Taifa Politics and Orientation Map reference sheet (1.3.1, 1.4)\\n• Two screens\\n• Six 6-sided dice (three yellow, three green)\\n• A background booklet (not needed for play)\\n• This rules booklet.\\n1.3 Game Board and Map\\n1.3.1 Map.

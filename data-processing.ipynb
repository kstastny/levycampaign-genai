It is the second volume \\nin GMT Games’ Levy & Campaign Series portraying medieval \\nmilitary operations. ',\n",
       " 'Players will raise and equip their armies and \\nthen send them out to ravage or conquer disputed territory and de-\\nfeat enemy forces. Service obligations and alliances will provide \\na panoply of lords and vassals to serve on campaign—but only \\nfor limited periods. Players must keep an eye on the calendar and \\nreward lords to keep them in the field. \\nAn advanced rule adds detail on vassal forces’ length of service. \\nPlayers may use optional screens that hide the strength of their \\nlords for greater fog of war. Though Almoravid has no solitaire \\nsystem, the standard game is solitaire friendly. \\nA player aid foldout and a separate Taifa reference sheet sum-\\nmarize key game functions. The last few pages of this rule book \\nprovide scenarios and key terms. A background booklet has sup-\\nporting material such as examples of play, tips on solitaire and \\nteam play, detailed histories of the era, and a separate minigame \\non its greatest battle.\\nThe page opposite lists rules changes from Levy & Campaign \\nSeries V olume I, Nevsky.

The Christian and \\nMuslim sides are Enemy to one another. The Christians repre-\\nsent the rising kingdoms of northern Spain and their allies. The \\nMuslims comprise the dynasties ruling a patchwork of Andalu-\\nsian emirates and their allies, including an Islamic Berber army \\nfrom Africa. \\nIn turns covering 40 days (a traditional period of military service), \\nChristian and Muslim players will levy lords and vassal forces, \\ngather transport, and recruit capabilities. Each lord’s forces and \\nassets are laid out on a mat. The players then plan and command a \\n40-day campaign with their mustered lords. A cylinder on the map\\nrepresents each lord, while markers on a calendar show how much\\ntime remains in the lords’ service, influenced by hunger, pay, and\\nsuccess or failure on campaign.\\nDESIGN NOTE: Christians and Muslims in medieval Ibe-\\nria warred not only on each other but on their co-religionists. \\n“Christian” and “Muslim” in this game refer to the player sides, \\neven though each side features adherents of either religion.\\n1.2 Components\\nA complete set of Almoravid includes: \\n• A mounted game board (1.3)\\n• Sixteen Lord cylinders (7 yellow, 9 green; 1.5.1)\\n• A Lords sticker sheet (1.5.1, apply to cylinders)\\n• Sixteen Lord mats (1.5.2)\\n• One Battle/Storm mat (4.4.1)\\n• 78 Horse \\nwedges (26 silver [Knights], 23 steel [Sergeants], 10\\nblue [African Horse], 19 brown [Light Horse])\\n• 83 Foot bars (30 steel [Men-at-Arms], 14 blue [African Foot],\\n33 brown [Militia], 6 tan [Serfs])\\n• Three sheets of markers and counters.\\n• Four decks of playing cards (26 Christian and 26 Muslim Arts\\nof W\\nar cards, 27 Christian and 33 Muslim Command cards, 1.9)\\n• Two player aid foldouts (summarizing Sequence of Play,\\nCommands, Forces, and Battles)\\n• A Taifa Politics and Orientation Map reference sheet (1.3.1, 1.4)\\n• Two screens\\n• Six 6-sided dice (three yellow, three green)\\n• A background booklet (not needed for play)\\n• This rules booklet.\\n1.3 Game Board and Map\\n1.3.1 Map.

Muslim Territo-\\nry comprises seven Taifas bordered in green—Badajoz, Toledo, \\nZaragoza, Lérida, Sevilla, Granada, and Valencia. \\uf075 Taifas can \\nbecome a “Parias” Taifa or “Reconquista” Taifa, rendering it Neu-\\ntral or Christian Territory instead (see ALLEGIANCE, below, and \\nTaifa Politics, 1.4).\\nNOTE: A Taifa Politics reference sheet summarizes rules about \\nterritory and allegiance and provides an orientation map on the \\nback.\\nLOCALES: Locales are the spaces on the map that hold mark-\\ners and Lord cylinders. Locales include Cities, Fortresses, Towns, \\nCastles, and Regions.\\n• Str\\nongholds: \\uf075 All Locales except Regions are Strongholds.\\nStrongholds are Conquerable, can host Lords Withdrawn in-\\nside them, and can be Besieged and Stormed (4.3.4-.5, 4.5).\\nThey show a Siege Capacity (\\uf075, \\uf076, or \\uf077) that affects how\\nmany Lords they can host and other aspects of Siege (4.5);\\nwhether they have \\uf075 Gardens that aid Forage (4.7.1); \\uf075 the\\nnumber of dice that they roll for Surrender (4.5.1); and wheth-\\ner they are a Port for Inviting the Almoravids (3.5.2) and for\\ncertain cards (1.9.1).\\n• Conquering:\\n Gray marker symbols at Strongholds indicate\\nthat they can receive “Conquered” or “Jihad” victory point\\nmarkers when taken (VP, 5.1). The number of gray symbols\\nshows the Stronghold’s Value—how many victory markers it\\nreceives: one marker if Castle or Town; two if Fortress; three\\nif City (see Strongholds on the foldout).\\n\\uf0b2 \\n When Conquering a Stronghold in En-\\nemy or Neutral territory (4.5.1-.2), a\\nside places its own 1VP Conquered\\nmarkers and \\nremoves any enemy Con-\\nquered, Jihad, and Seat markers there.\\n\\uf0b2 \\n \\uf075 When Muslims Conquer Strong-\\nholds in Enemy or Neutral (Recon -\\nquista or Parias, 1.4) Taifas, they\\nplace ½VP Jihad instead of 1VP\\nConquered.\\n\\uf0b2 When Conquering a Stronghold in Friendly T erritory, re-\\nmove all such Enemy markers there.\\n\\uf0b2 \\uf075 \\nConquest of a Stronghold flips any Ravage marker there\\n(4.7.2) to the other side’s color.\\n\\uf075ALLEGIANCE: Territory, Locales, and the Strongholds with-\\nin them are either Friendly to one side and Enemy to the other,\\nor they are Neutral (neither Friendly nor Enemy to either side):\\n• Kingdoms (within yellow borders) are Friendly T\\nerritory for\\nthe Christians.\\n• A \\nTaifa’s Territory (in green borders) becomes Friendly to the\\nChristians if Reconquista Taifa, Neutral when Parias Taifa,\\nand Friendly to the Muslims when Independent (1.4).\\n• Locales are Friendly\\n, Enemy, or Neutral per the Territory they\\noccupy except as listed below.\\n• Strongholds with Conquered, Jihad \\n(1.4.4), or Seat markers\\n(see below) are Friendly to the side of the color shown by the\\nmarker and Enemy to the other side regardless of Territory.\\nMuster (3.4), Pay with Loot (3.2.2), Withdrawal (4.3.4), and a few \\nother game actions require Friendly Locales; Siege (4.3.5) and \\nRavage (4.7.2) require an Enemy Locale as a target.\\nEXAMPLES: Lords do not Bypass and cannot Besiege Neutral \\nStrongholds (4.3.5). Because Ravage requires an Enemy Locale \\n(4.7.2), Christians within a Parias or Reconquista Taifa may Rav-\\nage only at a Jihad Stronghold (1.4). \\nSEATS: Some Strongholds host certain Lords’ Seats, as shown \\nby the Lord’s Pennnant (1.5.1) printed on the map there, affecting \\nReconquista (1.4.1), Call Upon an Emir (3.5.2), Muster (3.4.1), \\nSupply (4.6.1), and Tax (4.7.3). \\n\\uf075 SEAT MARKERS: Some Lords get Seat\\nmarkers at various Strongholds (1.8, 1.9.1,\\n3.5.1-.2). A Stronghold with a Seat marker is\\nFriendly to that Lord’s side. If the Enemy Con-\\nquers the Stronghold or that Lord leaves the\\nmap (4.5.1-.2, 3.3.1-.2), remove the Seat mark-\\ner (including Cathedrals).\\n\\uf075 PORTS: Ship icons at Locales affect the African\\nFleet/Guadalquivir  and Genoa & Pisa cards (1.9.1).\\n\\uf075GARDENS: Orange-tree icons at Cities and Fortress-\\nes show that they guarantee Forage (4.7.1).\\n\\uf075 WAYS: Two types of Ways—Road and Pass—link Locales to\\none another for movement and Supply (4.3, 4.4.3, 4.6), and cer-\\ntain cards (1.9.1). Locales linked by a Way are adjacent. Passes\\nhinder movement of Provender by Cart (4.3.2, 4.6.2).\\nON MAP: The phrases “on the map” and “on map” refer to Lords \\nor markers that are at Locales or, for markers, in the Taifas box \\n(1.3.3).

Each Taifa’s Territory has one of three statuses \\nper the following conditions:\\n•\\n Reconquista when all of a Taifa’s Cities and\\nprinted Seats (1.3.1, not Seat markers) are Chris-\\ntian Conquered (wherever its Taifa Lord, 1.5.1).\\nNOTE: These Reconquista target Locales are dis-\\ntinctively marked on the map; see the map’ s legend.\\n•\\n Parias when it has at least one City or printed\\nSeat free of Christian Conquered but has no Taifa\\nLord (1.5.1) on the map.\\n• Independent when it has at least one City or printed Seat\\nfree of Christian Conquered and its Taifa Lord is on the map.\\nNOTE: Toledo has no Taifa Lord so is never Independent.\\nShow \\na Taifa’s status with a Reconquista marker, or a Parias \\nmarker, or nothing in the Taifa’s “Independent” square. Mark the \\nSevilla Taifa with three such markers instead of one. \\n• The instant that new conditions are met, also adjust other\\nmarkers there per 1.4.3.\\nDESIGN NOTE: Taifas (“factions”) were petty kingdoms that \\ninherited al-Andalus after the early 11th-Century breakup of the \\nCaliphate ruling all Muslim Spain. For ease of play, the game \\nmerges several smaller Taifas into the seven shown.\\n',\n",
       " '1.4.2 Characteristics. A Taifa’s status affects its Territory and \\nVictory as follows.\\n• Reconquista Taifas are Christian, except for\\nLocales with Jihad or Muslim Seat markers\\n(1.3.1, 1.4.4). As shown on the markers, each\\nsuch Taifa is immediately worth three \\nChristian\\nvictory points, nine if Sevilla (5.1, adjust Victory).\\n• Parias Taifas are Neutral, except for Locales \\nwith Conquered, Jihad, or Seat markers\\n(1.3.1). Each such Taifa is \\n immediately worth one \\nChristian victory point, three if Sevilla (5.1, ad-\\njust Victory). \\n• Independent Taifas are Muslim, except for Locales with\\nChristian Conquered or Seat markers (1.3.1). They are\\nworth no victory points.\\nNOTES: Remember that Strongholds in Taifas receive Christian \\nConquered markers or Muslim Jihad markers, never Muslim \\nConquered markers (1.3.1, 1.4.4, 4.5). Reconquista of a Mustered \\nMuslim Lord’ s Taifa does not alone Disband him. \\n1.4.3 Adjusting Status. As Conquest of a Stronghold or Muster, \\nDisband, or removal of a Lord changes a Taifa’s status (1.4.1), \\nadjust its status, victory (1.4.2, 5.1), and other markers as follows. \\nNOTE: See the Taifa Politics sheet’ s summary chart.\\nPARIAS COIN: If changing \\nfrom Independent to Parias, the \\nChristians add Coin from the \\npool totaling the Disbanding Tai-\\nfa Lord’s Service (six if al-Mutamid, four if another) among any \\nUnbesieged Christian Lords’ mats.\\nRA V AGED LAND: If changing to Recon-\\nquista, flip all yellow Ravaged markers in the \\nTaifa to green (whatever the Locale’s status); \\nif to Independent, flip green to yellow (adjust V ictory, 5.1).\\nHOSTAGE POPULACE: Then, if changing to Reconquista or \\nIndependent , any Lords at Strongholds there that would change \\nfrom Neutral or Friendly (to them) into Enemy instead immediate-\\nly Conquer the Stronghold (4.5.1, no Spoils; place Christian \\nConquered or Jihad markers there equal to the Stronghold’s \\nVP value, 1.3.1; flip Ravaged; adjust Victory. 5.1). ',\n",
       " 'If to \\nParias , Lords Conquer Strongholds that would change from \\nFriendly to them to Neutral. NOTE: Besieged or Bypassed Lords \\nremain so. \\nRECOGNITION OF NEUTRALITY? Next, if changing \\nto Parias, the Christian then the Muslim side, wherever in the \\nTaifa it has any Lords Besieging or Bypassing an Enemy \\nStronghold that just became Neutral (has no Conquered or \\nJihad markers), chooses either to:  \\n• Remove its Siege or Bypass markers there, OR\\n• Add Enemy Conquered or Jihad, the number of markers equal\\nto the Stronghold’s victory V\\nalue—Christian Conquered if\\nMuslim Siege or Bypass, Jihad if Christian Siege or Bypass\\n(adjust victory).\\nOPEN GATES: Finally, any Lords Besieging or Bypassing \\nStrongholds that just became Friendly remove all Siege or Bypass \\nmarkers there.\\nNOTE: Other than per above, Conquered, Jihad, Siege, Seat, and \\nRavage markers (1.3.1, 1.4.4, 4.7.2) already on the map remain \\nregardless of Taifa status. For example, Christian Conquered \\nmarkers remain in Parias and Reconquista Taifas even though \\nthe Territory is no longer Muslim.\\n1.4.4 Jihad. Changes in Taifa status (1.4.3), Muslim \\nConquests in Taifas (4.5), Call to Arms (3.5.1), and \\nMuslim cards (1.9.1) can place “Jihad” markers at \\nStrongholds. A single Stronghold may end up with any number of \\nJihad markers—unlike Conquered markers, regardless of the \\nStronghold’s Victory value (1.3.1).\\nImportant: Add Jihad markers only in Reconquista and Parias \\nTaifas (1.4.1-.2, never in Kingdoms or Independent Taifas), \\nonly at Strongholds (never Regions), not at a Christian Con-\\nquered marker, or at a Christian Seat marker, or at a Christian \\nLord unless he is Besieging or Bypassing the Stronghold.',\n",

Their\\nstatus as Taifa Lords affects Taifa Politics (1.4), Chris-\\ntian Ravage (4.7.2) can shift their Service, and certain Events and \\nCapabilities apply to them—those with the word “Taifa” over a \\npennant (1.9.1).\\nDESIGN NOTE: The seventh Taifa on the map (1.4), Toledo, \\nhas no Taifa Lord in the game, reflecting the political weakness \\nand subservience to Alfonso of its last emir, al-Qadir. Muslim \\nLords Yusuf, Sir, and Rodrigo al-Sayyid are not Taifa Lords; \\nthey are less tied to Taifa territories; markers show the locations \\nof their Seats.\\n\\uf075 RODRIGO: The Lord Rodrigo has\\ntwo cylinders, Service markers, mats, and\\nsides to his Seat marker—one for when\\nfighting on the Muslim side (“al-Sayyid”),\\none for when on the Christian side (“Campeador”). Scenarios that \\ninclude Rodrigo start with the green Muslim al-Sayyid cylinder \\non the Calendar and the yellow Christian Campeador cylinder set \\naside. The yellow cylinder can replace the green one during play, \\nvia Event or Call to Arms (3.1.3, 3.5.1).\\nDESIGN NOTE: Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, “El Cid”, in this pe-\\nriod fought alternately for both Muslim or Christian employers.\\nSERVICE MARKERS: Each Lord has a Service marker that \\nshows his Pennant, Service Rating (1.5.3), and (except for those \\nonly Mustered by Call to Arms, 3.5) Fealty roll. Each Vassal also \\nhas such a marker showing the Pennant of the Vassal’s Lord, Vas-\\nsal Forces (1.6), and (for most) a Service Rating (1.5.3). \\n• A Mustered \\nLord’s Service marker is placed on the Calendar\\nand shifts among boxes to show how much longer that Lord’s\\nService will last.\\n• Vassal markers \\nstay on their Lord’s Mat or—if playing with\\nthe Vassal Service advanced rule—similarly are placed and\\nshift on the Calendar (3.4.2).

Most Lords in Almoravid have Vassals (subordi-\\nnate nobles) who provide their Lords with additional Forces.
